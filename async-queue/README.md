# ASYNC QUEUE

## A BASIC COMCEPT

The basic functionality of an async queue can indeed be covered by the **enqueue** and **processQueue** methods. However, depending on the complexity of your use-case and the requirements you have, you might find it useful to add more methods or features to enhance the functionality and robustness of the async queue:

1. Clear Queue: A method to clear all pending tasks from the queue. This can be useful if you need to cancel all pending tasks under certain conditions.

2. Pause and Resume: Methods to pause and resume the processing of tasks in the queue. This can be helpful if you want to temporarily halt task execution and then resume it later.

3. Task Prioritization: Methods to allow tasks to be enqueued with different priorities, ensuring that high-priority tasks are processed before lower-priority ones.

4. Error Handling: More advanced error handling, such as the ability to handle errors for individual tasks, retry failed tasks, or notify an external error handling mechanism.

5. Concurrency Limiting: Methods to dynamically adjust the maximum number of concurrent tasks being processed, providing better control over resource usage.

6. Task Progress and Completion Events: Methods to provide feedback on task progress, completion, or other events. This can be useful for tracking task status.

7. Task Dependencies: Methods to manage tasks that depend on the completion of other tasks, allowing for more complex task orchestration.

8. Timeouts: Methods to add timeouts to tasks, ensuring that tasks are not stuck indefinitely if they take too long to complete.

9. Logging and Debugging: Methods to log or output debug information related to the queue's operation and task processing.

10. Custom Task Queuing Logic: Depending on your use-case, you might need to customize how tasks are enqueued, such as adding tasks at specific positions within the queue.

*Remember, the additional methods you add should align with your specific use-case requirements. Not every async queue needs these additional features, but they can greatly enhance the versatility and usefulness of the async queue in more complex scenarios.*
